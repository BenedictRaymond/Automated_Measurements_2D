A camera will be situated on the top of the plate. A material will be placed above the plate. Now I want to measure the perimeter and area of that material.


At first, Consider the material as closed shape with no holes inside it.

Now steps are,

1. Setup the Camera at 90 deg.
2. Calibrate the Camera to find Camera Matrix and Distortion Co-efficients.
3. Using the parameters convert the reference image to undistorted image and find the pixel - cm ratio.
3. Capture the Image and Convert it into Distorted Image and Pre-process it.
4. Apply Contours to detect the boundary and calculate area and perimeter.


Pre-Processing Steps:

1. Crop the edges to remove the extra curvature.
2. Now, Calculate Area and Perimeter by differentiating as light bg with dark metal - Area of Total Metal.
3. Crop the image to square shape by length as highest side of metal.
4. Now, Calculate Area and Perimeter by differentiating as dark (metal) with light (bg) - Area of Total Remains.
5. At Last, Total Area of Proper Metal = Area of Total Metal - Area of Total Remains.
